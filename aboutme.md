My name is Tian. I am an assistant professor of Information Systems and Operations Management @ Emory University's Goizueta Business School. I also teach the undergraduate process and systems management course at the Goizueta Business School. This is my [CV](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1uqk6nQfHkdkdUoSPxBd935MoAoseOirn/view).

### research interests

These are topics I'm broadly interested in: New product / service development, design management, empirical operations, teams, patents.

### my history

I grew up in Malaysia and Singapore. Love history/fiction, traveling, running, (and now less actively) basketball and RPG games. I also received my BS degree from UC Berkeley, MS degree from Stanford University, and my PhD degree from INSEAD. Before my PhD I worked for about six years in technology and operations development @ PSA International, a global transportation company.
