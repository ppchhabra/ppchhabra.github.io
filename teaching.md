I have taught an undergrad course on Operations Management at Georgia Tech Scheller College of Business in both **face-to-face** and **online** modes in **Spring 2020** due to the Pandemic. My teaching philosophy involves providing a stimulating environment where students with diverse backgrounds get an equal opportunity to clarify their doubts and learn to realize their full potential. This is my [Teaching Statement](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1HySroIrA78BWHwNt41104Z45hRUpCinM/view?usp=sharing).

I have also served as teaching assistant for several courses at the Undergrad, Graduate and Exec-Ed levels.

### Teaching Experience

* Instructor for *Operations Management* core course for undergrad business students in Spring 2020.

### Teaching Evaluations

I conducted a student feedback survey at the end of the semester for my undergraduate *Operations Management* class in Spring 2020. I prepared this survey in Qualtrics, similar in content to the Course Instructor Opinion Survey (CIOS). Generally, Georgia Tech conducts CIOS every semester, but Georgia Tech decided not to run CIOS in Spring 2020 due to the change in teaching mode from in-person to virtual in the middle of the semester. My average teaching rating for “instructor effectiveness” is 4.79 out of 5, where 5 is excellent. I am also rated high for “concern for students’ learning” (4.71) and “accommodating nature” (4.87).
