I have taught an undergrad course on Operations Management at Georgia Tech Scheller College of Business in both **face-to-face** and **online** modes in **Spring 2020** due to the Pandemic. My teaching philosophy involves providing a stimulating environment where students with diverse backgrounds get an equal opportunity to clarify their doubts and learn to realize their full potential. This is my [Teaching Statement](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1HySroIrA78BWHwNt41104Z45hRUpCinM/view?usp=sharing).
