We investigate the effect of a creator's decisions on the reward structure design parameters of a reward-based crowdfunding campaign. In our study using data from a reward-based crowdfunding platform, we find that performance of a reward-based campaign improves with more rewards choices but with diminishing returns. The performance improves with more choices of dissimilar options or less choices of similar options. We also find that more choice is detrimental in the product-reward categories as compared to the experiential-reward categories. The availability of external signals of a creator's legitimacy reduces the need to provide more reward choices to improve performance of a reward-based crowdfunding campaign.
