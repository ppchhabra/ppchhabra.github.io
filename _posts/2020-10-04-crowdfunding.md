with [Manpreet Hora](https://www.scheller.gatech.edu/directory/faculty/hora/index.html) and [Karthik Ramchandran](https://www.scheller.gatech.edu/directory/faculty/ramachandran/index.html).

We investigate the effect of a creator's decisions on the reward structure design parameters of a reward-based crowdfunding campaign. In our study using data from a reward-based crowdfunding platform, we find that funding success of a reward-based campaign improves with more rewards choices but with diminishing returns. The funding success improves with more choices of rewards with less price dispersion. Contrary to what we expected, we find that the benefit of offering more rewards is lesser for the product reward categories compared to the experiential-reward categories. Finally, we find that the benefit of offering more rewards is higher for naive creators as compared to the experienced creators.
