There is a considerable variation in the patent grant lags for the patents filed with USPTO. We investigate the effect of patent grant delays, operationalized as patent grant lags, on the inventors' future innovative activities. We find that inventors reduce their innovative activities on experiencing delays. We also find that the delays not only affect inventors' patenting activities, but also harms the future value of their inventions. Further, we find that inventors concentrate their innovation portfolio in a limited technological sub-domains where the expected patent grant delay is smaller.
