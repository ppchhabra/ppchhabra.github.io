There is a huge varition in the patent grant lags for the patents filed with USPTO. We investigate the effect of patent grant delays, operationalized as patent grant lags, on the inventors' future innovative activities. We find that inventors reduce their innovative activities on experiencing delays. We also find that the delays not only affect inventors' patenting activities, it also harms the future value of their inventions. Further we find that inventors concentrate their innnovation portfolio in a limited technological sub-domains where the expectated patent grant delay is smaller.
