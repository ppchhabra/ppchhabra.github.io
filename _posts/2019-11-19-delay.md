There is a huge varition in the patent grant lags for the patents filed with USPTO. We investigate the effect of patent grant delays, operationalized as patent grant lags, on the inventors' future innovative activities. We find that inventors reduce their innovative activities on experiencing delays. We also find that the inventors not only reduce patenting, but it also affect the future value of their inventions. Further it also try to concentrate their innnovation portfolio in the specific technological sub-domains where the expectated patent grant delay is less.
