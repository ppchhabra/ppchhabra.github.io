A new design can be compared with its contemporaries or older designs. In this study, we argue that the temporal distance between the new design and its comparison play an important role in understanding how a new designâ€™s similarity with other designs contributes to its market valuation. Construing the value of designs as a combination of their informational value and their expressive value, we propose the anchored differentiation hypothesis. Specifically, we argue that the market audience weighs the expressive value (which enhances with how much the new design appears different from others) more than the informational value (which enhances with how much the new design appears similar to others) when the comparison is made to contemporary designs. However, the market weighs informational value more than expressive value when the comparison is made against designs from the past.
