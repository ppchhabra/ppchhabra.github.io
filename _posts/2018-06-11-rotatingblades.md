We develop a new two-noded, twelve degree of freedom finite element for rotating blades. The shape functions are derived from the exact solutions of the governing static homogenous differential equations for the rotating blades. It is observed that the new shape functions lead to much more rapid convergence than the conventional polynomial shape functions for the first few modes at higher rotation speeds, where the effect of centrifugal stiffening is higher. The basis functions can also be used for finite element analysis of rotating rods and beams, and for energy methods. Check out the [paper](https://doi.org/10.1080/15502280903446838).
